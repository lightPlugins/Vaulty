# What is Vaulty?

<hr></hr>

**Vaulty** is an enhanced version of the super old **VaultAPI** & **Vault**, encompassing all the methods that Vault provides by
default. This means that no changes need to be made to existing plugins (exceptions being
all Economy plugins). Additionally, it introduces new features such as **using BigDecimals
instead of doubles**, employing **UUIDs instead of Strings or OfflinePlayers**, and providing
**asynchronous methods for all new functions**. There are also new methods, for example, to
retrieve all Economy Account holders from the database as a HashMap.
