# What is Vaulty?

**Vaulty** is an enhanced version of the super old **VaultAPI** & **Vault**, encompassing all the methods that Vault provides by
default. This means that no changes need to be made to existing plugins (exceptions being
all Economy plugins). Additionally, it introduces new features such as **using BigDecimals
instead of doubles**, employing **UUIDs instead of Strings or OfflinePlayers**, and providing
**asynchronous methods for all new functions**. There are also new methods, for example, to
retrieve all Economy Account holders from the database as a HashMap.

# Why you should start using Vaulty today?

The original Vault plugin is out of date and no longer keeping pace with current standards. 
For three years, the community has been desperately urging the developer to bring it 
up to date, but to no avail. Here comes Vaulty into play. It is based on Vault, 
aiming to make the transition as smooth as possible for other developers and their existing 
plugins. Nothing has changed for such users. Ultimately, only new features have been added 
to cover today's standards and fulfill the community's long-awaited desires.
